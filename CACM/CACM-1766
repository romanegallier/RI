Quasilinearization and the Estimation of Differential Operators from Eigenvalues Given a linear ordinary differential operator containing several unknown constants and a number  of its eigenvalues, the values of the unknown constants are estimated.  A precise formulation is provided,  and an effective numerical procedure for solution is indicated.   The results of some computational experiments  are given. CACM April, 1968 Bellman, R. E.
