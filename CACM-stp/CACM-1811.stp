case study programming parallelprocessors affirmative partial answer provided question program  parallelprocessor computing systems efficiently decrease execution time problems  parallelprocessor  systems multiprocessor systems processors simultaneously execute separate  tasks single job cooperating decrease solution time computational problem  processors independent instruction counters meaning processor executes task program  independently processors  communication cooperating processors  means data storage shared processors  program determination distribution  electrical network written parallelprocessor computing system execution  program simulated  data gathered simulation runs demonstrate efficient solution  problem typical large class important problems  shown proper programming  solution time processors applied approaches 1n times solution time single processor  improper programming actually lead increase solution time number processors   stability method solution investigated cacm december 1969 rosenfeld
