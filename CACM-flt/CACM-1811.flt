a case study in programming for parallelprocessors an affirmative partial answer is provided to the question of whether it is possible to program  parallelprocessor computing systems to efficiently decrease execution time for useful problems  parallelprocessor  systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of the processors can simultaneously execute separate  tasks of a single job thus cooperating to decrease the solution time of a computational problem the  processors have independent instruction counters meaning that each processor executes its own task program  relatively independently of the other processors  communication between cooperating processors is by  means of data in storage shared by all processors  a program for the determination of the distribution  of current in an electrical network was written for a parallelprocessor computing system and execution  of this program was simulated  the data gathered from simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution  of this problem typical of a large class of important problems  it is shown that with proper programming  solution time when n processors are applied approaches 1n times the solution time for a single processor  while improper programming can actually lead to an increase of solution time with the number of processors   stability of the method of solution was also investigated cacm december 1969 rosenfeld j l
