an efficient contextfree parsing algorithm a parsing algorithm which seems to be the most efficient general contextfree  algorithm known is described  it is similar to both knuths lrk algorithm  and the familiar topdown algorithm  it has a time bound proportional to  n3 where n is the length of the string being parsed in general it has a  n2 bound for unambiguous grammars and it runs in linear time on a large  class of grammars which seems to include most practical contextfree programming language grammars  in an empirical comparison it appears to be superior to the topdown and bottomup algorithms studied by griffiths  and petrick cacm february 1970 earley j
