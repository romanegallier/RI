an improved programsynthesizing algorithm and its correctness an improved programsynthesizing algorithm based on the algorithm proposed by waldinger and  lee in 1969 is given  in the old algorithm the programsynthesizing problem is translated into a theoremproving  problem and a program is obtained by analyzing a proof  for the improved algorithm the analysis is  not necessary and a program is obtained as soon as the proof is completed  this is achieved by using  a modified variable tracing mechanism invented by green in 1969  the correctness of the improved algorithm  is also proved ie the program thus obtained always satisfies the specification cacm april 1974 lee r c t chang c l waldinger r j
