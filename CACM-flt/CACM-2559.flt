the reallocation of hashcoded tables when the space allocation for a hashcoded table is altered the table entries must be rescattered  over the new space  a technique for accomplishing this rescattering is presented  the technique is  independent of both the length of the table and the hashing function used and can be utilized in conjunction  with a linear reallocation of the table being rescattered  moreover it can be used to eliminate previously  flagged deletions from any hashcoded table or to change from one hashing method to another  the efficiency  of the technique is discussed and theoretical statistics are given cacm january 1973 bays c
