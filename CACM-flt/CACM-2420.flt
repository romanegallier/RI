experiments with an automatic theoremprover havingpartial ordering inference rules automatic theoremprovers need to be made much more efficient  with this in mind slagle has  shown how the axioms for partial ordering can be replaced by builtin inference rules when using a particular  theoremproving algorithm based upon hyperresolution and paramodulation  the new rules embody the transitivity  of partial orderings and the close relationship between  predicates  a program has been developed using  a modified version of these rules  this new theoremprover has been found to be very powerful for solving  problems involving partial orderings  this paper presents a detailed description of the program and  a comprehensive account of the experiments that have been performed with it cacm november 1973 slagle j r norton l m
