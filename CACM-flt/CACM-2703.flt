the intrinsically exponential complexity of the circularity problem for attribute grammars attribute grammars are an extension of contextfree grammars devised by knuth as a mechanism  for including the semantics of a contextfree language with the syntax of the language  the circularity  problem for a grammar is to determine whether the semantics for all possible sentences programs in  fact will be well defined  it is proved that this problem is in general computationally intractable   specifically it is shown that any deterministic algorithm which solves the problem must for infinitely  many cases use an exponential amount of timean improved version of knuths circularity testing algorithm  is also given which actually solves the problem within exponential time cacm december 1975 jazayeri m ogden w f rounds w c
