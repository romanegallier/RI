complex gamma function with error control an algorithm to compute the gamma function and log gamma function of a complex variable is presented   the standard algorithm is modified in several respects to insure the continuity of the function value  and to reduce accumulation of roundoff errors  in addition to computation of function values this  algorithm includes an objecttime estimation of roundoff errors  experimental data with regard to the  effectiveness of this error control are presented  a fortran program for the algorithm appears in the  algorithms section of this issue cacm april 1972 kuki h
