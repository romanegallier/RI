register allocation via usage counts this paper introduces the notion of usage counts shows how usage counts can be developed by  algorithms that eliminate redundant computations and describes how usage counts can provide the basis  for register allocation  the paper compares register allocation based on usage counts to other commonly  used register allocation techniques and presents evidence which shows that the usage count technique  is significantly better than these other techniques cacm november 1974 freiburghouse r a
