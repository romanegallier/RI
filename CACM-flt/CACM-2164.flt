symbolic integration the stormy decade three approaches to symbolic integration in the 1960s are described  the first from artificial  intelligence led to slagles saint and to a large degree to moses sin  the second from algebraic  manipulation led to manoves implementation and to horowitz and tobeys reexamination of the hermite  algorithm for integrating rational functions  the third from mathematics led to richardsons proof  of the unsolvability of the problem for a class of functions and for rischs decision procedure for the  elementary functionsgeneralizations of rischs algorithm to a class of special functions and programs  for solving differential equations and for finding the definite integral are also described cacm august 1971 moses j
