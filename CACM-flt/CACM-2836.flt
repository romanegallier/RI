weighted derivation trees the nodes of a weighted derivation tree are associated with weighting functions over the vocabulary  of a contextfree grammar  an algorithm is presented for constructing the optimal derivation tree having  the same structure as a given weighted derivation tree  in addition the correctness of the algorithm  is established  the method may be applied to problems involving probabilistic parsing or combinatorial  optimization cacm september 1976 loui m c
