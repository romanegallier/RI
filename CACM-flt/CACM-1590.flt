pitch period determination of speech sounds a computer procedure which determines pitch periods by the recognition of the peak structure  of the speech waveform is described  speech sounds were sampled by a microphone and an analogtodigital  converter attached to an interconnected ibm 7090pdp1 system  these utterances were recorded at the  normal noise level of the computer room but were not bandcompressed or phasedistorted in any manner   a sequence of operations defined on the speech wave selects a list of points along the waveform as candidates  for pitch markers  these markers are validated by an error detection and correction procedureabout  95 percent of the pitch periods were recognized correctly within 1 to 2 times realtime on the ibm 7090 cacm june1967 reddy d r
