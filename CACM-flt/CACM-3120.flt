an eventdriven compiling technique due to the linear structure of source text difficulties may arise in a  onepass compilation process  these difficulties occur when an entity cannot be processed because of a forward reference to information only obtainable from subsequent entities  classic solutions ask for data structures appropriate for each case  a technique is presented here which uses instead control structures namely events and processes  the work of the compilerwriter becomes easier both conceptually and in practice because he can forget these problems at the outset and he avoids special processing for each problem this technique has been applied to the construction of an algol 68 compiler  three examples from that implementation are described and discussed here cacm january 1979 banatre jp routeau jp trilling l
