guarded commands nondeterminacy and formal derivation of programs socalled guarded commands are introduced as a building block for alternative and repetitive  constructs that allow nondeterministic program components for which at least the activity evoked but  possible even the final state is not necessarily uniquely determined by the initial state  for the  formal derivation of programs expressed in terms of these constructs a calculus will be shown cacm august 1975 dijkstra e w
