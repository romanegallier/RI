is sometime sometimes better than always intermittent assertions in proving program correctness this paper explores a technique for proving the correctness and termination of programs simultaneously   this approach the intermittentassertion method involves documenting the program with assertions that  must be true at some time when control passes through the corresponding point but that need not be true  every time  the method introduced by burstall promises to provide a valuable complement to the more  conventional methods  the intermittentassertion method is presented with a number of examples of correctness  and termination proofs  some of these proofs are markedly simpler than their conventional counterparts   on the other hand it is shown that a proof of correctness or termination by any of the conventional  techniques can be rephrased directly as a proof using intermittent assertions  finally it is shown  how the intermittentassertion method can be applied to prove the validity of program transformations  and the correctness of continuously operating programs cacm february 1978 manna z waldinger r
