assembling code for machines with spandependent instructions many modern computers contain instructions whose lengths depend on the distance from a given  instance of such an instruction to the operand of that instruction  this paper considers the problem  of minimizing the lengths of programs for such machines  an efficient solution is presented for the  case in which the operand of every such spandependent instruction is either a label or an assemblytime  expression of a certain restricted formif this restriction is relaxed by allowing these operands to  be more general assemblytime expressions then the problem is shown to be npcomplete cacm april 1978 szymanski tg
