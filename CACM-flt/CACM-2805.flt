perturbations of eigenvalues of nonnormal matrices the problem considered is to give bounds for finite perturbations of simple and multiple eigenvalues  of nonnormal matrices where these bounds are in terms of the eigenvalues the departure from normality  and the frobenius norm of the perturbation matrix but not in terms of the eigen system  the bounds which  are derived are shown to be almost attainable for any set of matrices  cacm january 1975 van der sluis a
