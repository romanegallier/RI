computing connected components on parallel computers we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time olog2n  an olog2n time bound also can be achieved using only nnlog2n processors the algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure of a symmetric boolean matrix  we assume that the processors have access to a common memory  simultaneous access to the same location is permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions cacm august 1979 hirschberg ds chandra ak sarwate dv
