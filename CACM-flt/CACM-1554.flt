a computer technique for displaying ndimensional hyperobjects a digital computer and automatic plotter have been used to generate threedimensional stereoscopic  movies of the threedimensional parallel and perspective projections of fourdimensional hyperobjects  rotating in fourdimensional space  the observed projections and their motions were a direct extension of threedimensional experience but no profound feeling or insight into the fourth spatial dimension  was obtained  the technique can be generalized to ndimensions and applied to any ndimensional hyperobject  or hypersurface cacm august 1967 noll a m
