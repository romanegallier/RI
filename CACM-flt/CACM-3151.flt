an optimal realtime algorithm for planar convex hulls an algorithm is described for the construction in realtime of the convex hull of a set of n points in the plane   using an appropriate data structure the algorithm constructs the convex hull by successive updates each taking time olog n thereby achieving a total processing time on log n   cacm july 1979 preparata fp
