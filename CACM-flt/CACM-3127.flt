thoth a portable realtime operating system  thoth isa realtime operating system which is designed to be portable over a large set of machines  it is currently running on two minicomputers with quite different architectures  both the system and application programs which use it are written in a highlevel language because the system is implemented by the same software on different hardware it has the same interface to user programs  hence application programs which use thoth are  highly portable  thoth encourages structuring programs as networks of communicating processes  by providing efficient interprocess communication primitives cacm february 1979 cheriton dr malcolm ma melen la sager gr
