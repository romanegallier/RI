approximate solution of initial boundary wave equation problems by boundaryvalue techniques a new boundaryvalue technique is proposed for the treatment of initialboundaryvalue problems  for linear and mildly nonlinear wave equations   several illustrative examples are offered to demonstrate  the ease with which the method can be applied cacm november 1968 greenspan d
