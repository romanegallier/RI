optimal surface reconstruction from planar contours in many scientific and technical endeavors a threedimensional solid must be reconstructed  from serial sections either to aid in the comprehension of the objects structure or to facilitate its  automatic manipulation and analysis  this paper presents a general solution to the problem of constructing  a surface over a set of crosssectional contours  this surface to be composed of triangular tiles  is constructed by separately determining an optimal surface between each pair of consecutive contours  determining such a surface is reduced to the problem of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed  toroidal graph  a new fast algorithm for finding such cycles is utilized  also developed is a closedform  expression in term of the number of contour poin ts for an upper bound on the number of operations required  to execute the algorithm  an illustrated example which involves the construction of a minimum area surface  describing a human head is included cacm october 1977 fuchs h kedemz m uselton s p
