on the stability of gaussjordan elimination with pivoting the stability of the gaussjordan algorithm with partial pivoting for the solution of general  systems of linear equations is commonly regarded as suspect  it is shown that in many respects suspicions  are unfounded and in general the absolute error in the solution is strictly comparable with that corresponding  to gaussian elimination with partial pivoting plus back substitution  however when a is ill conditioned  the residual corresponding to the gaussjordan solution will often be much greater than that corresponding  to the gaussian elimination solution cacm january 1975 peters g wilkinson j h
