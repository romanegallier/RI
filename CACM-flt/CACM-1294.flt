note on tripleprecision floatingpoint arithmetic with 132bit numbers in a recent paper gregory and raney described a technique for doubleprecision floatingpoint  arithmetic  a similar technique can be developed for tripleprecision floatingpoint arithmetic and  it is  the purpose of this note to describe this technique  only the multiplication and the division  algorithms are described since the additionsubtraction algorithm can be obtained by a trivial modification  of the algorithm in gregorys and raneys paper cacm march 1965 ikebe y
