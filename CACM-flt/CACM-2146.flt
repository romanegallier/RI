optimizing the polyphase sort various dispersion algorithms for the polyphase sorting procedure are examinedthe optimum  algorithm based on minimizing the total number of unit strings read is displayed  the logic of this  algorithm is rather complicated hence several other new dispersion algorithms with more straightforward  logic are presented  of the simple dispersion algorithms discussed the  horizontal is best  it does  approximately onefourth to one and onehalf percent less reading and writing than most algorithms in  use today  an additional two and onefourth to three percent improvement can be achieved by utilizing  the modified optimum algorithm  this algorithm is relatively straightforward but it requires a fairly  close estimate of the total number of unit strings before the dispersion begins cacm november 1971 shell d l
