a highly parallel algorithm for approximating all zeros of a polynomial with only real zeros an algorithm is described based on newtons method which simultaneously approximates all zeros  of a polynomial with only real zeros  the algorithm which is conceptually suitable for parallel computation  determines its own starting values so that convergence to the zeros is guaranteed  multiple zeros and  their multiplicity are readily determined  at no point in the method is polynomial deflation used cacm november 1972 patrick m l
