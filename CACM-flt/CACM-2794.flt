statespace problemreduction and theorem provingsome relationships this paper suggests a bidirectional relationship between statespace and problemreduction  representations it presents a formalism based on multipleinput and multipleoutput operators which  provides a basis for viewing the two types of representations in this manner  a representation of the  language recognition problem which is based on the cocke parsing algorithm is used as an illustration   a method for representing problems in firstorder logic in such a way that the inference system employed  by a resolutionbased theorem prover determines whether the set of clauses is interpreted in the statespacer  mode or in the problemreduction mode is presented  the analogous concepts in problemreduction and  theorem proving and the terminology used to refer to them are noted  the relationship between problemreduction  input resolution and linear resolution is discussed cacm february 1975 vanderbrug g j minker j
