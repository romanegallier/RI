recovery of reentrant list structures in slip one consequence of the referencecountbased spacerecovery system employed by slip is that  reentrant list structures are not recovered even when explicitly erased  lisplike garbagecollection  schemes are free of this impediment  they however depend on being able to find and mark nodes that  are reachable from program variables  by tracing all descendants from program variables may then be  identified and collected  the listcreating function list of slip may be amended to mark those lists  for which the programmer wishes to assume responsibility  given this modification a lisplike garbage  collector that recovers abandoned reentrant list structures may then be appended to the slip system cacm july 1969 weizenbaum j
