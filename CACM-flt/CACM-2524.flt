some approaches to bestmatch file searching the problem of searching the set of keys in a file to find a key which is closest to a given  query key is discussed  after closest in terms of a metric on the the key space is suitably defined  three file structures are presented together with their corresponding search algorithms which are intended  to reduce the number of comparisons required to achieve the desired result these methods are derived  using certain inequalities satisfied by metrics and by graphtheoretic concepts  some empirical results  are presented which compare the efficiency of the methods cacm april 1973 burkhard w a keller r m
