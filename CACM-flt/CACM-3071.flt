an algorithm using symbolic techniques for the belpetrov classification of gravitational fields in this note an algorithm is presented for the symbolic calculation of certain algebraic invariants  of the weyl tensor which permits the determination of the belpetrov types of a gravitational field   this algorithm although more specialized than that of dinverno and russellclark requires neither  the use of a special coordinate system nor the spin coefficient formalism  the algorithm has been implemented  in formac and is designed to complete the classification scheme proposed by petrov in his book  an appendix  contains examples illustrating the use of the algorithm cacm september 1978 harris ra zund jd
