automatic data structure choice in a language of very high level setl is a settheoretically oriented language of very high level whose repertoire of semantic  objects includes finite sets ordered ntuples and sets of ordered ntuples usable as mappings  this  paper describes the structure of an optimizer for this language  among other methods of interest the  optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusion and membership to be established the domains  and ranges of tabulated mappings to be estimated from above and below and the singlevaluedness of  tabulated mappings to be proved  once facts of this kind have been established automatic choice of  data structures becomes possible the methods employed are based upon and extend known techniques of  data flow analysis cacm december 1975 schwartz j t
