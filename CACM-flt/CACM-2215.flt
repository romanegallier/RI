application of game tree searching techniques to sequential pattern recognition a sequential pattern recognition spr procedure does not test all the features of a pattern  at once  instead it selects a feature to be tested  after receiving the result of that test the procedure  either classifies the unknown pattern or selects another feature to be tested etc  medical diagnosis  is an example of spr  in this paper the authors suggest that spr be viewed as a oneperson game played  against nature chance  virtually all the powerful techniques developed for searching twoperson strictly  competitive game trees can easily be incorporated either directly or by analogy into spr procedures   in particular one can incorporate the mini average backingup procedure and the gamma procedure  which are the analogues of the minimax backingup procedure and the alphabeta procedure respectively   some computer simulated experiments in character recognition are presented  the results indicate that  the approach is promising cacm february 1971 slagle j r lee r c t
