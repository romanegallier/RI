spline function methods for nonlinear boundaryvalue problems the solution of the nonlinear differential equation yfxyy with twopoint boundary conditions  is approximated by a quintic or cubic spline function yx  the method is well suited to nonuniform  mesh size and dynamic mesh size allocation  for uniform mesh size h the error in the quintic spline  yx is oh4 with typical error onethird that from numerovs method  requiring the differential  equation to be satisfied at the mesh points results in a set of difference equations which are block  tridiagonal and so are easily solved by relaxation or other standard methods cacm june 1969 blue j l
