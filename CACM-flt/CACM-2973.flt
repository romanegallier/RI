sorting on a meshconnected parallel computer two algorithms are presented for sorting n2 elements on an n x n meshconnected processor  array that require on routing and comparison steps  the best previous algorithm takes time on log  n  the algorithms of this paper are shown to be optimal in time within small constant factors  extensions  to higherdimensional arrays are also given cacm april 1977 thompson c d kung h t
