connections between accuracy and stability properties of linear multistep formulas this paper is concerned with stability and accuracy of families of linear kstep formulas depending  on parameters with particular emphasis on the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations   an upper bound pk is derived for the order of accuracy of ainfstable formulas  three criteria  are given for a0stability  it is shown that 1 for pk k arbitrary ainfstability implies certain  necessary conditions for a0stability and for strict stability meaning that the extraneous roots of  ppsi satisfy psi1 2 for pk234and 5 ainfstability for k5 together with another constraint  implies strict stability and 3 for certain oneparameter classes of formulas with pk34andor 5  ainfstability implies a0stability cacm january 1975 liniger w
