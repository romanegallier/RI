on overcoming highpriority paralysis in multiprogramming systems a case his tory highpriority paralysis is the degradation that can occur in multiprogramming systems when  scheduling is based primarily on preassigned priorities  it can be alleviated by modifying the scheduling  algorithm to maximize the number of programs active at one time  the case his tory given in this paper  indicates two general methods by which simultaneity can be increased  possible refinements in the scheduling  algorithm for future improvements are considered briefly cacm august 1968 stevens d f
