a queuing model of a multiprogrammed computer with a twolevel storage system the results are presented of an analysis of a probabilistic model of a multiprogrammed computer  system with a twolevel storage system in which there is sequential dependency of accesses between the  devices  expressions are obtained for the longrun probability that both the cpu and each of the storage  devices are busy  some numerical results are given which quantify the gains in cpu utilization obtainable  by multiprogramming in the presence of this type of storage system cacm january 1973 shedler g s
