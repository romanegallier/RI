minimal eventnode network of project precedence relations a procedure for constructing a minimal eventnode network to represent a set of precedence  relations without parallel activities is presented  a minimal eventnode network is an eventnode network  in which both the number of nodes and the number of arcs are the minima to preserve the given precedence  relations counterexamples are given to show that the algorithm presented by a c fisher j s liebman  and g l nemhauser 1968 produces eventnode networks which are not minimal  since our procedure includes  the setcovering problem the time required may grow exponentially with the number of given activities cacm may 1973 corneil d g gotlieb c c lee y m
