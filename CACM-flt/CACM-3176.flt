storing a sparse table the problem of storing and searching large sparse tables is ubiquitous in  computer science  the standard technique for storing such tables is hashing but hashing has poor worstcase performance  we propose a good worstcase method for storing a static table of n entries each an integer between 0 and n  1  the method requires 0n w words of storage and allows ologn n access time  although our method is a little complicated to use in practice our analysis shows why a simpler algorithm used for compressing lr parsing tables works so well cacm november 1979 tarjan re yao acc
