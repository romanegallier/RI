formal requirements for virtualizable third generation architectures virtual machine systems have been implemented on a limited number of third generation computer  systems eg cp67 on the ibm 36067  from previous empirical studies it is known that certain third  generation computer systems eg the dec pdp10 cannot support a virtual machine system  in this paper  model of a thirdgenerationlike computer system is developed  formal techniques are used to derive  precise sufficient conditions to test whether such an architecture can support virtual machines cacm july 1974 popek g j goldberg r p
