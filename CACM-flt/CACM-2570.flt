a comparison of list schedules for parallel processing systems the problem of scheduling two or more processors to minimize the execution time of a program  which consists of a set of partially ordered tasks is studied  cases where task execution times are  deterministic and others in which execution times are random variables are analyzed  it is shown that  different algorithms suggested in the literature vary significantly in execution time and that the bschedule  of coffman and graham is nearoptimal  a dynamic programming solution for the case in which execution  times are random variables is presented cacm december 1974 adam t l chandy k m dickson j r
