computational algorithms for closed queueing networks with exponential servers methods are presented for computing the equilibrium distribution of customers in closed queueing  networks with exponential servers  expressions for various marginal distributions are also derived   the computational algorithms are based on twodimensional iterative techniques which are highly efficient  and quite simple to implement  implementation considerations such as storage allocation strategies and  order of evaluation are examined in some detail cacm september 1973 buzen j p
