feedback coupled resource allocation policies in the multiprogramming multiprocessor computer  system model studies of some integrated feedbackdriven scheduling systems for multiprogrammed multiprocessor  computer systems are presented  the basic control variables used are the dataflow rates for the processes  executing on the cpu  the model systems feature simulated continuousflow and preemptresume scheduling  of inputoutput activity  attention is given to the amount of memory resource required for effective  processing of the io activity buffer space assignment  the model studies used both distributiondriven  and tracedriven techniques  even relatively simple dynamic schedulers are shown to improve system performance  as measured by user cpu time over that given by optimal or nearoptimal static schedulers imbeded  in identical system structures and workload environments  the improvement is greatest under a heavy  io demand workload cacm august 1978 brice rs browne jc
