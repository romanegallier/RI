general equations for idealized cpuio overlap configurations general equations are derived for estimating the maximum possible utilization of main storage  partitions cpu and io devices under different conditions in an idealized cpuio overlap model of multiprogrammed  computer systems  the equations are directly applicable to any configuration consisting  of sets of  identical cpus io processors main storage partitions and user tasks  examples are provided to illustrate  the use of the equations to compute effective processing time per record and expected timesharing response  time under both balanced and unbalanced resource utilization conditions  cacm june 1978 teory tj
