on the nearoptimality of the shortestlatencytimefirst drum scheduling discipline for computer systems in which it is practical to determine the instantaneous drum position  a popular discipline for determining the sequence in which the records are to be accessed is the socalled  shortestlatencytimefirst sltf discipline  when a collection of varyinglength records is to be  accessed from specified drum positions it is known that the sltf discipline does not necessarily minimize  the drum latency time  however we show that the total time to access the entire collection for any  sltf schedule is never as much as a drum revolution longer than a minimum latency schedule cacm june 1973 stone h s fuller s  h
