approximate solution of axially symmetric problems a variety of physical problems in such diverse fields as electrostatic  field theory heat  and ideal fluid flow and stress concentration theory reduce under the assumption of axial symmetry  to the study of an elliptic partial differential equation  dirichlettype problems associated with this  equation are studied on regions whose boundaries include a nondegenerate portion of the xaxis and exceedingly  accurate numerical methods are given for approximating solutions cacm june 1964 greenspan d
