ndimensional codes for detecting and correcting multiple errors the paper introduces a new family of codes for detecting and correcting multiple errors in  a binarycoded message  the message itself is arranged conceptually into a multidimensional rectangular  array  the processes of encoding and error detection are based upon parity evaluations along prescribed  dimensions of the array  effectiveness of the codes is increased by introducing a system check bit  which is essentially a parity check on the other parity bits  only threedimensional codes are discussed  in this paper with parity evaluations along the horizontal the vertical and one main diagonal  however  the family of codes is not restricted to three dimensions as evidenced by the discussion by minnick  and ashenhurst on a similar multidimensional singlebit selection plan used for another purpose 6   a fourdimensional code correcting three and detecting four errors has been developed the extension  to higherdimensional codes with greater correction power is straightforward cacm december 1961 rubinoff m
