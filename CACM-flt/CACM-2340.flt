a boolean matrix method for the computation of linear precedence functions a modified version of bells boolean matrix method for the computation of linear precedence  functions associated with a conflictfree matrix of precedence relations is given  this algorithm not  only detects when the precedence functions do not  exist but also provides an indication of why they  do not exist so that corrective action can be taken if possible  necessary and sufficient conditions  for the existence of precedence functions are given  the use of boolean matrices to prove the existence  of precedence functions associated with classes of conflictfree grammars is illustrated through an example cacm june 1972 martin d f
