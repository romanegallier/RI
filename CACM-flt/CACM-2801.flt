storageefficient representation of decimal data usually n decimal digits are represented by 4n bits in computers  actually two bcd digits  can be compressed optimally and reversibly into 7 bits and three digits into 10 bits by a very simple  algorithm based on the fixedlength combination of two variable fieldlength encodings  in over half  of the cases the compressed code results from the conventional bcd code by simple removal of redundant  0 bits  a long decimal message can be subdivided into threedigit blocks and separately compressed  the result differs from the asymptotic minimum length by only 034 percent  the hardware requirement  is small and the mappings can be done manually cacm january 1975 chi chen t ho i t
