optimizing bittime computer simulation a major component of a bittime computer simulation program is the boolean compiler  the compiler  accepts the boolean functions representing the simulated computers digital circuits and generates corresponding  sets of machine instructions which are subsequently executed on the host computer  techniques are  discussed for increasing the sophistication of the boolean compiler so as to optimize bittime computer  simulation  the techniques are applicable to any generalpurpose computer cacm november 1963 katzj h
