oneline random number generators and their use in combinations some oneline random number generators ie generators requiring a single fortran instruction  are discussed and some short fortran programs which mix several such generators are described  the  aim is to provide methods for incorporating random number generators directly in fortran programs by  means of a few inline instructions  the advantages are speed avoiding linkage to and from a subroutine  convenience and versatility  anyone wishing to experiment with generators either using congruential  generators by themselves or mixing several generators to provide a composite with potentially better  statistical properties than the library generators currently available may wish to consider some of  the simple fortran program discussed here  cacm november 1968 marsaglia g bray t a
