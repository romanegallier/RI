graph coloring conditions for the existence of solutions to the timetable problem a necessary and sufficient condition is presented for the existence of a solution to the gotlieb  classteacher timetable problem  several relationships are established between the classteacher timetable  problem and graphs with preconditions  these preconditions place additional restrictions on the coloration  of a graph  the preconditions correspond to the unavailability constraints and preassigned meetings  in the classteacher timetable problem  using some recent results that convert graphs with preconditions  to graphs without them it is shown that the existence of a coloration of a graph is the required necessary  and sufficient condition cacm august 1974 neufeld g a tartar j
