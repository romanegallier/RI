remote online realtime computer diagnosis of the clinical electrocardiogram presented in this paper is a brief report on the hardware software system configuration and  function of a system for the remote online realtime digital computer diagnosis of clinical electrocardiograms   it seems likely that efforts of this sort will lead to a satisfactory solution to the problem of the  automatic diagnosis of electrocardiograms  current attempts by the authors to extend the diagnostic  capabilities of the present system are particularly concerned with increasing the fidelity of the adaptive  matched filters the development of three dimensional pattern analysis the analysis of parallel electrocardiographercomputer  diagnostic interaction and a study of the possibility of introducing major treelike branching decisions  early in the diagnostic process cacm january 1965 whipple g h dickson j f horibe h stark l
