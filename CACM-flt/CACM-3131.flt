focus microcomputer number system focus is a number system and supporting computational algorithms especially useful for microcomputer control and other signal processing applications  focus has the wideranging character of floatingpoint numbers with a uniformity of state distributions that give focus better than a twofold accuracy advantage over an equal word length floatingpoint system  focus computations are typically five times faster than single precision fixedpoint or integer arithmetic for a mixture of operations comparable in speed with hardware arithmetic for many applications  algorithms for 8bit and 16bit implementations of focus are included cacm march 1979 edgar ad lee sc
