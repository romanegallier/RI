dynamic spacesharing in computer systems a formalization of relationships between spaceshading program behavior and processor efficiency  in computer systems is presented  concepts of value and cost of space allocation per task are defined  and then value and cost are combined to develop a single parameter termed value per unit cost  the intent  is to illustrate a possible analytic approach to the investigation of the problems of spacesharing and  to demonstrate the method on sample problems cacm may 1969 belady l a kuehner c j
