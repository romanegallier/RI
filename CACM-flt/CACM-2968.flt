a comparison of treebalancing algorithms several algorithmsheightbalance ie avl and extensions weightbalance ie bb and wb  and total restructuringfor building balanced binary search trees are compared  the criteria for comparison  encompass theoretical aspects eg path lengths and implementation independent and machinealgorithmdependent  measures eg run time  a detailed analysis of code is also presented at a level believed to be languageand  compilerindependent  the quality of the resulting trees and the overhead spent on building them are  analyzed and some guidelines are given for an efficient use of the methods  if insertion and subsequent  queries are the only operations of in terest then pure avl trees present the overall best qualities cacm may 1977 baer j l schwab b
