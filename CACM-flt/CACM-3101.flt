the sl5 procedure mechanism this paper describes an integrated procedure mechanism that permits procedures to be used as  recursive functions or as coroutines  this integration is accomplished by treating procedures and their  activation records called environments as data objects and by decomposing procedure invocation into  three separate components at the sourcelanguage level  in addition argument binding is under the control  of the programmer permitting the definition of various methods of argument transmission in the source  language itself  the resulting procedure mechanismwhich is part of the sl5 programming language is  well suited to goaloriented problems and to other problems that are more readily programmed by using  coroutines several examples are given  cacm may 1978 hanson d griswold re
