code structures for protection and manipulation of variablelength items when items are made up of a variable number of characters each containing the same number  of bits certain control information partition symbols is inserted to mark their separations  since  errors in identification of these control characters can lead to serious trouble methods of protecting  these symbols are indicated  a 6bit code assignment of alphanumeric characters for fixed wordlength  computers is given and its suitability for error detection and variablelength item manipulation is shown   also indicated is its flexibility during certain arithmetic operations cacm january 1965 ramamoorthy c v
