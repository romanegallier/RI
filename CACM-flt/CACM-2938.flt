toward a discipline of realtime programming programming is divided into three major categories with increasing complexity of reasoning  in program validation sequential programming multiprogramming and realtime programming  by adhering  to a strict programming discipline and by using a suitable highlevel language molded after this discipline  the complexity of reasoning about concurrency and execution time constrain ts may be drastically reduced   this may be the only practical way to make realtime systems analytically verifiable and ultimately  reliable  a possible discipline is outlined and expressed in terms of the language modula cacm august 1977 wirth n
