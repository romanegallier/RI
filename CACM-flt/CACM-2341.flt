blocksa new data type for snobol4 a new data type called a block has been implemented for snobol4  a block is a threedimensional  aggregate of characters in the form of a right parallelepiped best thought of as a threedimensional  extension to a string  the third dimension is used for overstriking  blocks may be printed concatenated  in any of three dimensions and merged on the basis of programdefined connection points  some blocks  adapt in size and shape to their environment  blocks and their operations are mainly used for composing  printable output  a variety of graphical problems including flowcharting bargraphs logic diagrams  mathematicalequation formation and text justification and preparation have been programmed on a printer  in what appears to be an easy and natural way  in addition to these somewhat specialized applications  blocks appear to be a good general purpose deviceindependent output formation mechanism especially suitable  for nonnumerical work  the concept of a block is largely language independentthat is blocks require  little in the way of specialized syntax and could readily be absorbed into the external structure of  most programming languages cacm june 1972 gimpel j f
