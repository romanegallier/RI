a comparative analysis of disk scheduling policies five wellknown scheduling policies for movable head disks are compared using the performance  criteria of expected seek time system orientedand expected waiting time individual io request oriented   both analytical and simulation results are obtained  the variance of waiting time is introduced as  another meaningful measure of performance showing possible discrimination against individual requests   then the choice of a utility function to measure total performance including system oriented and individual  request oriented measures is described  such a function allows one to differentiate among the scheduling  policies over a wide range of input loading conditions  the selection and implementation of a maximum  performance twopolicy algorithm are discussed cacm march 1972 teorey t j pinkerton t b
