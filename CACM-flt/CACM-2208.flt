storage utilization in a memory hierarchy when storage assignment is performed by a hashing algorithm the utilization of storage is studied in a twolevel memory hierarchy  the first storage level  which is the fast store is divided into a number of storage areas  when an entry is to be filed in  the hierarchy a hashing algorithm will attempt to place the entry into one of these areas  if this  particular area is full then the entry will be placed into the slower secondlevel store even though  other areas in the firstlevel store may have space available  given the n entries have been filed in  the entire hierarchy an expression is derived for the expected number of entries filed in the firstlevel  storethis expression gives a measure of how effectively the firstlevel store is being used  by means  of examples storage utilization is then studied as a function of the hashing algorithm the number of  storage areas into which the firstlevel store is divided and the total size of the firstlevel store  cacm march 1971 williams j g
