the conversion of limitedentry decision tables to optimal and nearoptimal flowcharts two new  algorithms two new algorithms for deriving optimal and nearoptimal flowcharts from limited entry decision  tables are presented  both take into account rule frequencies and the time needed to test conditions   one of the algorithms called the optimumfinding algorithm leads to a flowchart which truly minimizes  execution time for a decision table in which simple rules are already contracted to complex rules  the  other one called the optimumapproaching algorithm requires many fewer calculations but does not necessarily  produce the optimum flowchart  the algorithms are first derived for treating decision tables not containing  an elserule but the optimumapproaching algorithm is shown to be equally valid for tables including  such a rule  both algorithms are compared with existing ones and are applied to a somewhat large decision  table derived from a real case  from this comparison two conclusions are drawn  1 the optimumapproaching  algorithm will usually lead to better results than comparable existing ones and will not require more  but usually less computation time2 in general the greater computation effort needed for applying  the optimumfinding algorithm will not be justified by the small reduction in execution time obtained cacm november 1972 verhelst m
