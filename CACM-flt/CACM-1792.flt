exploratory experimental studies comparing online and off line programming performance two exploratory experiments were conducted at system development corporation to compare debugging  performance of programmers working under conditions of online and off line access to a computer  these  are the first known studies that measure programmers performance under controlled conditions for standard  tasks  statistically significant results of both experiments indicated faster debugging under online  conditions but perhaps the most important practical finding involves the striking individual differences  in programmer performance  methodological problems encountered in designing and conducting these experiments  are described limitations of the findings are pointed out hypotheses are presented to account for results  and suggestions are made for further research cacm january 1968 sackman h erikson w j grant e e
