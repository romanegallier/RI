the effects of multiplexing on a computercommunications system a study is made of the way in which asynchronous time division multiplexing changes the stochastic  nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer and consequently affects the performance  of a timeshared computercommunications system  it is concluded that while for certain values of system  parameters there is noticeable improvement in the performance of the computer model in the sense  that timeshared scheduling delays are reduced these improvements are offset by the transmission delays  imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or no change in the computercommunications system  performance  analytical and simulation results are based on the model of the computercommunications  system being an md1 queue the multiplexor in tandem with a single exponential server the computer   analytical results include a general description of the output process of an md1 queue and the conditions  under which this output process is approximately poisson cacm march 1973 pack c d
