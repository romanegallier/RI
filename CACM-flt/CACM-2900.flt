some theorems to aid in solving the file allocation problem the file allocation problemie the problem of finding the optimal set of network sites at  which to locate copies of a fileis known to be in general polynomial complete  heuristics and other  aids to finding optimal or nearoptimal solutions are therefore much needed  in this paper we present  three theorems which can be applied a priori to indicate that certain sites should or should not be  included in an optimal allocation cacm november 1977 grapa e belford g g
