structural pattern recognition of carotid pulse waves using a general waveform parsing system a general waveform parsing system with application to structural pattern recognition of carotid  pulse waves is described  the carotid arterial pulse wave is of medical importance because of variation  in its structure induced by arterial aging and cardiovascular disease  the syntaxdriven waveform analysis  system has been applied with good results to these pulse waves to detect and measure structural variations   the waveform parsing system is modeled on a compilercompiler system and allows the user to enter application  specific information as data  it is thus general enough to be applicable to other waveforms cacm december 1976 stockman g kanal l kyle m c
