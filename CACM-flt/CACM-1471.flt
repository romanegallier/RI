programming semantics for multiprogrammed computations the semantics are defined for a number of metainstructions which perform operation essential  to the writing of programs in multiprogrammed computer systems  these metainstructions relate to parallel  processing protection of separate computations program debugging and the sharing among users of memory  segments and other computing objects the names of which are hierarchically structured  the language  sophistication contemplated is midway between an assembly language and an advanced algebraic language cacm march 1966 dennisj b vanhorn e c
