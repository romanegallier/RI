syntaxdirected leasterrors analysis for contextfree languages a practical approach a leasterrors recognizer is developed informally using the wellknown recognizer of earley  along with elements of bellmans dynamic programming  the analyzer takes a general class of contextfree  grammars as drivers and any finite string as input  recognition consists of a leasterrors count for  a corrected version of the input relative to the driver grammar the algorithm design emphasizes practical  aspects which help in programming it cacm january 1974 lyon g
