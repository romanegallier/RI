detection of threedimensional patterns of atoms in chemical structures an algorithm for detecting occurrences of a threedimensional pattern of objects within a larger structure is presented  the search technique presented uses the geometric structure of the pattern to define characteristics demanded of candidates for matching this is useful in cases where the properties of each atom considered individually do not adequately limit the number of sets of possible matchings several applications of this technique in the field of chemistry are 1 in pharmacology searching for a common constellation of atoms in molecules possessing similar biological activities 2 in xray crystallography fitting a structure or a structural fragment to a set of peaks in the electrondensity distribution of a fourier map 3 in chemical documentation retrieving from a file the structures containing specified substructures cacm april 1979 lesk am
