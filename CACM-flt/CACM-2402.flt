pictorial pattern recognition and the phase problem of xray crystallography the availability of interactive threedimensional computer graphics systems coupled to powerful  digital computers encourages the development of algorithms adapted to this environment  pictorial pattern  recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches to xray structure determination based on  molecular model building ie the use of chemical information to frame structural hypotheses which  can computationally be tested and refined by reference to the experimental data  application of standard  pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact that the crosscorrelation between a model and  the correct structure cannot be computed because of a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data   however it is possible to compute an upper bound to such a crosscorrelation  a simple example demonstrates  that this information can be the basis of a technique for structure determination that can make effective  use of an interactive graphics system model building by crosscorrelations has intrinsic advantages  over usual crystallographic techniques based on the autocorrelation or patterson function especially  for large structures  this is significant for crystallography of biological macromolecules hasbeen  and will continue to be a field of intense interest cacm january 1972 lesk a m
