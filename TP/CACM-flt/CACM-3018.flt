covering edges by cliques with regard to keyword conflicts and intersection graphs kellerman has presented a method for determining keyword conflicts and described a heuristic  algorithm which solves a certain combinatorial optimization problem in connection with this method   this optimization problem is here shown to be equivalent to the problem of covering the edges of a graph  by complete subgraphs with the objective of minimizing the number of complete subgraphs  a relationship  between this edgecliquecover problem and the graph coloring problem is established which allows algorithms  for either one of these problems to be constructed from algorithm for the other  as consequences of  this relationship the keyword conflict problem and the edgecliquecover problem are shown to be npcomplete  and if pnp then they do not admit polynomialtime approximation algorithms which always produce solutions  within a factor less than 2 from the optimum cacm february 1978 kou lt stockmeyer lj wong ck watson tj
