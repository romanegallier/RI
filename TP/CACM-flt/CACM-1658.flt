analysis of algorithms for the zeroone programming problem this paper is concerned with a review and examination of several existing algorithms for the  zeroone programming problem  computational experience is summarized  the machine time and storage  requirements of several of the algorithms are compared over several test problems of small and intermediate  size  computer experiments still provide little hope of solving problems with over 100 variables with  a reasonable amount of machine time cacm december 1968 gue r l liggett j c cain k c
