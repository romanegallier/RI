on a divideandcorrect method for variable precision division described in this paper is a divideandcorrect method for variable precision division in digital  computers  unlike the earlier methods of stein and pope the present method uses a suitably rounded  form of the normalized divisor for getting an estimate of the quotient characters  this results in a  correction of at most plus or minus one to the estimate to obtain the exact quotient character  it  is believed that this method will be widely applicable for division operations in variable wordlength  characteroriented machines cacm march 1965 krishnamurthy e v
