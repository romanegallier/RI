organizing matrices and matrix operations for paged memory systems matrix representations and operations are examined for the purpose of minimizing the page faulting  occurring in a paged memory system  it is shown that carefully designed matrix algorithms can lead to  enormous savings in the number of page faults occurring when only a small part of the total matrix can  be in main memory at one time  examination of addition multiplication and inversion algorithms shows  that a partitioned matrix representation ie one submatrix or partition per page in most cases induced  fewer page faults than a rowbyrow representation  the number of pagepulls required by these matrix  manipulation algorithms is also studied as a function of the number of pages of main memory available  to the algorithm cacm march 1969 mckellar a c coffman jr e g
