an analysis of some timesharing techniques the effectiveness of certain timesharing techniques such as program relocation disk rotational  delay minimization and swap volume minimization is investigated  summary data is presented and the  findings are discussed  the vehicle for this investigation was a simula based simulation model reflecting  an early framework for a planned burroughs b6500 timesharing system  inasmuch as the b6500 system is  based upon the use of variable sized segments and a dynamic overlay procedure data is also presented  which provides some indication of the effectiveness of this type of organization in a timesharing environment   the design characteristics and operational capabilities of the simulation model are also described cacm february 1971 nielsen n r
