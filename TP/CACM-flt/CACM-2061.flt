an algorithm for the construction of boundedcontext parsers an algorithm is described which accepts an arbitrary contextfree grammar and constructs a boundedcontext parser for it whenever such a parser exists  in the first part of the paper the definition of a contextfree grammar and the working of a boundedcontext parser are recalled  the notion of reduction class for a contextfree grammar is then introduced and its connection with the structure of a boundedcontext parser is indicated  next pushdown automata which generate the different reduction classes of a contextfree grammar are defined  finally the algorithm is described it essentially carries out an exhaustive study of all possible runs of the pushdown automata generating the reduction classes in the second part the utility of the algorithm is discuss ed in the light of the experience gained from its use in compiler design the algorithm is claimed to be particularly useful in the simultaneous design of a language and a compiler for it cacm may 1970 loeckx j
