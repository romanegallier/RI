on the optimization of performance of timesharing systems by simulation a simulation model of a timesharing system with a finite noncontiguous store and an infinite  auxiliary store is used to study the variation of system parameters such as store size number of jobs  allowed to execute simultaneously jobscheduling algorithm etc  the effects of these variations on  a measure of system performance is used to ascertain which of the parameters controllable by the jobscheduling  algorithm including the scheduling itself require optimization and which of the parameters not normally  controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked effect on system performance  system performance  is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed  it is shown that significant improvements  in the measure of system performance can be obtained by using variable timeslice techniques and by selecting  the optimum roundrobin cycle time  it appears that these features would benefit from optimization whereas  other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm affect system performance in a predictable  manner and would not benefit from optimization  features not normally under the control of the scheduling  algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure of performance in particular supervisor overheads  the size of the store and the speed of the cpu  a comparison is made between the results of the simulation  model and two analytical equations for quantumoriented nonpreemptive timesharing systems  the comparison  is found to be very favorable cacm june 1972 blatny j clark s r rourke t a
