synchronizing processors with memorycontentgenerated interrupts implementations of the lockunlock method of synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor  system usually require uninterruptable memorypause type instructions  an interlock scheme called readinterlock  which does not require memorypause instructions has been developed for a dual dec pdp10 system with  realtime requirements  the readinterlock method does require a specialreadinterlock instruction  in the repertoire of the processors and a special readinterlock cycle in the repertoire of the memory  modules  when a processor examines a lock a memory location with a readinterlock instruction it  will be interrupted if the lock was already set examining a lock immediately sets it if it was not already  set this event sequence is a readinterlock cycle  writing into a lock clears it  having the processor  interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead of branching is advantageous if the branch would have  resulted in an effective interrupt cacm june 1973 hill j c
