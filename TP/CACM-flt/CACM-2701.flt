a fast and usually linear algorithm for global flow analysis abstract onlycomplete paper jacm  231 january 1976 a new algorithm for global flow analysis on reducible graphs is presented the algorithm is  shown to treat a very general class of function spaces  for a graph of e edges the algorithm has a  worst case time bound of oe log e function operations  it is also shown that in programming terms  the number of operations is proportional to e plus the number of exits from program loops  consequently  a restriction to oneentry oneexit control structures linearity  the algorithm can be extended to yet  larger classes of function spaces and graphs by relaxing the time bound  examples are given of code  improvement problems which can be solved using the algorithm cacm december 1975 graham s l wegman m
