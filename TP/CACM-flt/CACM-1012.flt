formal parsing systems automatic syntactic analysis has recently become important for both natural language data processing  and syntaxdirected compilers  a formal parsing system g  vutr consists of two finite disjoint  vocabularies v and t a manymany map u from v onto t and a recursive set r of strings in t called  syntactic sentence classes  every program for automatic syntactic analysis determines a formal parsing  system  a directed production analyzer itxp is a nondeterministic pushdownstore machine with internal  vocabulary i input vocabulary t and all productions of p in the form  za  ay1  ym where  z  yi are elements of the set i and a is an element of the set t  every contextfree language can be analyzed  by a directed production analyzer  the kunooettinger multiplepath syntactic analyzer for english is  a concrete example of a directed production analyzer and of a working parsing algorithm  the connection  between structures assigned by the analyzer and those of a conventional phrase structure grammar is examined  in this paper cacm august 1964 greibach s a
