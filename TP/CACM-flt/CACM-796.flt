sabrag a timesharing lowcost computer the serial sabrac computer designed and built in the scientific department of the israel defense  ministry has a 5000location magnetic drum main store  to avoid a need to resort to optimum programming  techniques and to increase its overall efficiency the computer has also been given a 224word ferrite  core store from which the program is obeyed  transfers between the core and drum stores and to and from  the twin papertape input and output channels are all available autonomously concurrently timeshared   multiplication and division orders are also autonomous so that the machine may be executing up to three  orders simultaneously  all functions naturally are interlocked  a number of other advanced orders and  facilities are also incorporatedin particular an execute order permits a temporary jump for up  to four orders and a second modifier register permits double modification in general and relative addressing  of subroutines in particular  thus the overall effective speed of the machine is muchhigher than its  basic specification would lead one to expect and its design indicates one way in which the concepts of  time sharing may be incorporated in lowcost computers cacm august 1963 lehman m netter z eshed r
