general performance analysis of keytoaddress transformation methods using an abstract file  concept this paper presents a new approach to the analysis of performance of the various keytoaddress  transformation methods  in this approach the keys in a file are assumed to have been selected from the  key space according to a certain probabilistic selection algorithm  all files with the same number of  keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted in accordance with the algorithm and the  average performance of the transformation methods on these files will be used as the potential of these  methods  using this analysis methods with the same overall performance can be classified and key distributions  partial to certain transformations can be identified  all this can be done analytically  the approach  is applied to a group of transformation methods using files whose keys are selected randomly cacm october 1973 lum v y
