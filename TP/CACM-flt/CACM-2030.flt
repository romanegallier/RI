contextsensitive parsing this paper presents a canonical form for contextsensitive derivations and a parsing algorithm which finds each contextsensitive analysis once and only once  the amount of memory required by the algorithm is essentially no more than the required to  store a single complete derivation  in addition a modified version of the basic algorithm is presented which blocks infinite analyses  for grammars which contain loops  the algorithm is also compared with several previous parsers for contextsensitive grammars and general rewriting systems and the difference between the two types of analyses is discussed  the algorithm appears to be complementary to an algorithm by s kuno in several respects including  the spacetime tradeoff and the degree of context dependence involved cacm july 1970 woods w a
