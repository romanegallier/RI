algorithm  logic  control an algorithm can be regarded as consisting of a logic component which specifies the knowledge to be used in solving problems and a control component which determines the problemsolving strategies by means of which that knowledge is used  the logic component determines the meaning of the algorithm whereas the control component only affects its efficiency  the efficiency of an algorithm can often by improving the control component without changing the logic of the algorithm  we argue that computer programs would be more often correct and more easily improved and modified if their logic and control aspects were identified and separated in the program text  cacm july 1979 kowalski r
