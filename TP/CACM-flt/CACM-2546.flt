the use of grammatical inference for designing programming languages both in designing a new programming language and in extending an existing language the designer  is faced with the problem of deriving a natural grammar for the language  we are proposing an interactive  approach to the grammar design problem wherein the designer presents a sample of sentences and structures  as input to a grammatical inference algorithm  the algorithm then constructs a grammar which is a reasonable  generalization of the examples submitted by the designer  the implementation is presently restricted  to a subclass of operator precedence grammars but a second algorithm is outlined which applies to a  larger class of contextfree grammars cacm february 1973 crespireghizzi s melkanoff m a lichten l
