a technique for generating almost optimal floydevans productions for precedence grammars a technique is developed for generating almost optimal floydevans productions  given a precedence grammar a graph formulation is used for the problem of  merging productions  the productions generated correspond to the minimum cost  inversearborescence of that graph  the validity of the technique is demonstrated for weak precedence grammars defined here but the productions mechanically generated for any precedence grammar can often be modified in  such a way that correct almost optimal parsers are obtained cacm august 1970 ichbiah j d morse s p
