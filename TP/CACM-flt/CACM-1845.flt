loader standardization for overlay programs the overlay capability is described for four of the third generation computer systems cdc6000  ge635 ibm360 and univac1108  a critique of the first three systems is based on actual experience  with a large overlaid trajectory simulation program a short history and description of this program  is presented  a standardization of minimum capabilities for loaders is recommended so that programs  which must operate under more than one computer system may be easily converted and maintained  a proposal  that overlay software incorporates a memory occupation specification concept instead of the conditional  tree structure is delineated  this concept provides more efficient and costeffective utilization of  the memory as well as increased flexibility in program structure cacm october 1969 lanzano b c
