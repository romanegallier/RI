multiple precision floatingpoint conversion from decimaltobinary and vice versa decimaltobinary and binarytodecimal floatingpoint conversion is often performed by using  a table of the powers 10i ia positive integer for converting from base 10 to base 2 and by using  a table of the coefficient of a polynomial approximation of 10x 0x1 for converting from base 2  to base 10  these tables occupy a large storage region in the case of a nonsingle precision conversion   this paper shows that a single small table suffices for a floatingpoint conversion from decimal to  binary and vice versa in any useful precision cacm may 1966 mancino o g
