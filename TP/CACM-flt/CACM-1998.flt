complex matrix inversion versus real a comparison of complex matrix with real matrix inversion is made  it is shown that the complex inversion can be up to  twice as fast as the real inversion  further the rounding error bound for complex inversion is about oneeighth that of real for gaussian elimination  using extended inner product accumulation the bound is half of the real system cacm september 1970 ehrlich l w
