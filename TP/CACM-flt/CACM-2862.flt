analysis of the pff replacement algorithm via a semimarkov model an analytical model is presented to estimate the performance of the page fault frequency pff  replacement algorithm  in this model program behavior is represented by the lru stack distance model  and the pff replacement algorithm is represented by a semimarkov model  using these models such parameters  as the interpagefault interval distribution the probability of the number of distinct pages being  referenced during an interpagefault interval etc are able to be analytically determined  using these  models to evaluate these parameter values permits study of the performance of the replacement algorithm  by simulating the page fault events rather than every page reference event  this significantly reduces  the required computation time in estimating the performance of the pff algorithm cacm may 1976 chu w w opderbeck h
