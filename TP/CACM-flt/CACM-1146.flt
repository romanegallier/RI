an efficient composite formula for multidimensional quadrature a 2s1point seconddegree quadrature formula for integration over an sdimensional hyperrectangle  is presented  all but one of the points lie on the surface with weights of opposite sign attached to  points on opposite faces  when a large volume is subdivided into congruent rectangular subdivisions  only one point is required in each interior subdivision to achieve seconddegree accuracy cacm january 1964 thacher jr h c
