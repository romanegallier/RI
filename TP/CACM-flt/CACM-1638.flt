sorting by replacement selecting in sorting by replacement selecting the expected length of a sequence beginning with the ith  element i1 is proved to be 2f in accordance with a conjecture of e h friend where f is the number  of memory cells used  the expected length of the jth sequence is determined to be f times a jth degree  polynomial in e such that the value of this polynomial approaches 2 as j approaches infinity  recursive  formulas are obtained for both the mean and the standard deviation of the length of the jth sequence   the mathematical proofs of these results are based upon the assumption that n the number of items to  be sorted is infinite but it is shown that the error due to the finiteness of n approaches zero rapidly  as n increases cacm february 1967 gasner b j
