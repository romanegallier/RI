an algorithm for hidden line elimination the algorithm presented causes the elimination of hidden lines in the representation of a perspective  view of concave and convex planefaced objects on the picture plane  all the edges of the objects are  considered sequentially and all planes which hide every point of an edge are found  the computing time  increases roughly as the square of the number of edges  the algorithm takes advantage of a reduced number  of concave points and automatically recognizes if only one object with no concave points is considered  in this last case the result is obtained in a much simpler way cacm april 1969 galimberti r montanari u
