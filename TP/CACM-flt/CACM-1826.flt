a lisp garbagecollector for virtualmemory computer systems in this paper a garbagecollection algorithm for listprocessing systems which operate within  very large virtual memories is described  the object of the algorithm is more the compaction of active  storage than the discovery of free storage  because free storage is never really exhausted the decision  to garbage collect is not easily made therefore various criteria of this decision are discussed cacm november 1969 fenichel r r yochelson j c
