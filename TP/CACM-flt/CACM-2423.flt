a parsergenerating system for constructing compressed compilers this paper describes a parsergenerating system pgs currently in use on the cdc6500 computer  at purdue university  the pgs is a fortrancoded compiler  in the input translation grammar each bnf  syntactic rule corresponds to a possibly empty code generator realizable as an assembly language  fortran or algol subroutine that is called whenever that syntactic rule is applied in the parse of a  program  typical onepass compilers constructed by the pgs translate source programs at speeds approaching  14000 cards per minute  for an xpl compiler the parser program and its tables currently occupy 288  words of 60bit core memory of which 140 words are parsing table entries and 82 words are links to code  generators cacm november 1973 mickunas m d schneider v b
