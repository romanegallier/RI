pattern width at a given angle that the pattern feature width as a function of angle possesses several possible interpretations  is demonstrated in this paper which is a review of the width concept in pattern recognition and the  geometrical concept itself  the object of the work is to clarify how the word description can be made  precise so that computer algorithms for feature extraction may be obtained the focus is on the theoretical  subject matter  the results consist of a settheoretic definition of widthatangle a theorem relating  it to the pattern boundary radius vector and descriptions of alternate widths  all widths are calculated  for an illustrative example graphical and tabular comparisons are given  substantial variation in widthatangle  magnitude is found  the principal conclusion is that the settheoretic widthatangle is a useful pattern  feature when it can be easily computed  further investigation of the information contained in only part  of a width function is recommended for cases where computation of widthatangle is difficult cacm january 1971 klinger a
