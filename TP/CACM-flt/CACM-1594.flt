an algorithm for generating permutations an algorithm is described which under repeated application generates all permutations of k  elements  only the previously generated permutation the constant k and a temporary index are needed   starting with a particular ordering of k elements abcd repeated application of the algorithm will  generate k1 additional permutations by k1 successive rotations  from the initial circular ordering  of k objects another circular ordering can be obtained by rotating the k1 lowest elements  for each  new k1 circular ordering another k2 can be obtained by rotating the k2 lowest elements  by continuing  in this manner applications of the algorithm will generate all k1 circular orderings or since each  circular ordering yields k permutations the algorithm generates all k permutations cacm may 1967 langdon jr g g
