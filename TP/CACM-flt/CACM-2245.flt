tracedriven modeling and analysis of cpu scheduling in multiprogramming system microscopic level job stream data obtained in a production environment by an eventdriven software  probe is used to drive a model of a multiprogramming computer system  the cpu scheduling algorithm of  the model is systematically varied  this technique called tracedriven modeling provides an accurate  replica of a production environment for the testing of variations in the system  at the same time alterations  in scheduling methods can be easily carried out in a controlled way with cause and effects relationships  being isolated  the scheduling methods tested included the best possible and worst possible methods  the traditional methods of multiprogramming theory roundrobin firstcomefirstserved etc and dynamic  predictors  the relative and absolute performances of these scheduling methods are given  it is concluded  that a successful cpu scheduling method must be preemptive and must prevent a given job from holding  the cpu for too long a period cacm december 1972 sherman s baskett iii f browne j c
