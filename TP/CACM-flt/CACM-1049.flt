numerical solution of nonlinear twopoint boundary problems by finite difference methods solution of nonlinear twopoint boundaryvalue problems is often an extremely difficult task   quite apart from questions of reality and uniqueness there is no established numerical technique for  this problem  at present shooting techniques are the easiest method of attacking these problems  when  these fail the more difficult method of finite differences can often be used to obtain a solution   this paper gives examples and discusses the finite difference method for nonlinear twopoint boundaryvalue  problems cacm june 1964 holt j f
