on complement division the division algorithm theorem is expressed in a form that permits it to serve as the basis  for devising division operations that produce both quotient and remainder in complement form  algorithms  for division yielding complement results are derived for numbers represented in any base greater than  one  both radix and radixlessone complementation schemes are considered  the binary form of the algorithms  thus includes both twos and ones complement implementation  the problem of quotient overflow for complement  results is dealt with as is that of selecting an appropriate form of the remainder condition for complement  division  cacm april 1971 stein m l munro w d
