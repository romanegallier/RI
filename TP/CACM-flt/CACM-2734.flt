on the external storage fragmentation produced by firstfit and bestfit allocation strategies published comparisons of the external fragmentation produced by firstfit and bestfit memory  allocation have not been consistent  through simulation a series of experiments were performed in order  to obtain better data on the relative performance of firstfit and bestfit and a better understanding  of the reasons underlying observed differences the timememoryproduct efficiencies of firstfit and  bestfit were generally within 1 to 3 percent of each other  except for small populations the size  of the request population had little effect on allocation efficiency  for exponential and hyperexponential  distributions of requests firstfit outperformed bestfit but for normal and uniform distributions  and for exponential distributions distorted in various ways bestfit outperformed firstfit  it is  hypothesized that when firstfit outperforms bestfit it does so because firstfit by preferentially  allocating toward one end of memory encourages large blocks to grow at the other end  sufficient contiguous  space is thereby more likely to be available for relatively large requests  results of simulation experiments  supported this hypothesis and showed that the relative performance of firstfit and bestfit depends  on the frequency of request  when the coefficient of variation of the request distribution is greater  than or approximately equal to unity firstfit outperformed bestfit cacm august 1975 shore j e
