interval arithmetic determinant evaluation and its use in testing for a chebyshev system two recent papers one by hansen and one by hansen and r r smith have shown how interval  arithmetic ia can be used effectively to bound errors in matrix computations  in the present paper  a method proposed by hasen and r r smith is compared with straightforward use of ia in determinant  evaluation  computational results show the accuracy and running times that can be expected when using  ia for determinant evaluation  an application using ia determinants in a program to test a set of  functions to see if they form a chebyshev system is then presented cacm february 1969 smith l b
