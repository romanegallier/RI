median split trees a fast lookup technique for frequently occuring keys split trees are a new technique for searching sets of keys with highly skewed frequency distributions   a split tree is a binary search tree each node of which contains two key valuesa node value which is  a maximally frequent key in that subtree and a split value which partitions the remaining keys with  respect to their lexical ordering between the left and right subtrees  a median split tree mst uses  the lexical median of a nodes descendents as its split value to force the search tree to be perfectly  balanced achieving both a space efficient representation of the tree and high search speed  unlike  frequency ordered binary search trees the cost of a successful search of an mst is log n bounded and  very stable around minimal values  further an mst can be built for a given key ordering and set of  frequencies in time n log n as opposed to n2 for an optimum binary search tree  a discussion of the  application of msts to dictionary lookup for english is presented and the performance obtained is contrasted  with that of other techniques cacm november 1978 sheil ba
