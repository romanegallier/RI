improving roundoff in rungekutta computations with gills method a rungekuttagill scheme in common use is based on an incomplete adaptation for floating point operations of gills method  an improved version reduces roundoff error significantly  in this note the heart of the scheme is presented in fortran language  it is then shown how an improved version of the method can be obtained with the addition of two fortran statements  the two version is a significant improvement  a numerical example comparing the two is included cacm december 1970 thompson r j
