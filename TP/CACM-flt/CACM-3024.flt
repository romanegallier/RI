the cray1 computer system this paper describes the cray1 discusses the evolution of its architecture and gives an  account of some of the problems that were overcome during its manufacture  the cray1 is the only computer  to have been built to date that satisfies erdas class vi requirement a computer capable of processing  from 20 to 60 million floating point operations per second 1  the cray1s fortran compiler cft  is designed to give the scientific user immediate access to the benefits of the cray1s vector processing  architecture  an optimizing compiler cft vectorizes innermost do loops  compatible with the ansi  1966 fortran standard and with many commonly supported fortran extensions cft does not require any source  program modifications or the use of additional nonstandard fortran statements to achieve vectorization   thus the users investment of hundreds of man months of effort to develop fortran programs for other  contemporary computers is protected cacm january 1978 russell rm
