the development of the mu5 computer system following a brief outline of the background of the mu5 project the aims and ideas for mu5  are discussed  a description is then given of the instruction set which includes a number of features  conducive to the production of efficient compiled code from highlevel language source programs  the  design of the processor is then traced from the initial ideas for an associatively addressed name store  to the final multistage pipeline structure involving a prediction mechanism for instruction prefetching  and a function queue for array element accessing  an overall view of the complete mu5 complex is presented  together with a brief indication of its performance cacm january 1978 ibbett rn capon pc
