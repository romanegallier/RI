numerical integration of a differentialdifference equation with a decreasing timelag systems in which variable timelags are present are of common occurrence in biology  variable  flow rates are a common cause of these variable lags  at present no extensive body of knowledge exists  concerning the effects which these variable lags can cause  shown here is a method of reducing some  differentialdifference equations to ordinary differential equations which can then be studied numerically  with ease  subsequent study will deal with situations in which multiplelags and lags dependent on the  solution itself are present cacm april 1965 bellman r e buell j d kalaba r e
