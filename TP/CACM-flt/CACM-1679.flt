a fast fourier transform algorithm for realvalued series a new procedure is presented for calculating the complex discrete fourier transform of realvalued  time series  this procedure is described for an example where the number of points in the series is  an integral power of two  this algorithm preserves the order and symmetry of the cooleyturkey fast  fourier transform algorithm while effecting the twotoone reduction in computation and storage which  can be achieved when the series is real  also discussed are hardware and software implementations of  the algorithm which perform only n4 log2 n2 complex multiply and add operations and which require  only n real storage locations in analyzing each npoint record cacm october 1968 bergland g d
