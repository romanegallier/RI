timesharing and batchprocessing  an experimental comparison of their values in a problem   solving situation an experimental comparison of problemsolving using timesharing and batchprocessing computer  systems conducted at mit is described in this paper  this study is the first known attempt to evaluate  two such systems for what may well be the predominant user population within the next decadethe professionals  who as nonprogrammers are using the computer as an aid in decisionmaking and problemsolving rather  than as a programming end in itself  statistically and logically significant results indicate equal  cost for usage of the two computer systems however a much higher level of performance is attained by  timesharing users  there are indications that significantly lower costs would have resulted if the  timesharing users had stopped work when they reached a performance level equal to that of the batch  users  the users speed of problemsolving and their attitudes made timesharing the more favorable  system cacm may 1969 gold m m
