the use of interactive graphics to solve numerical problems with the advent of online timesharing computer systems and graphic terminals we have available a new dimension in numerical problem solving capabilities  rather than simply use the new power to achieve fast turnaround we can develop interactive routines which are easy to use and also take advantage of the insight and visual capabilities of the human problem solver  several online systems for general purpose mathematical problem solving have already been implemented as well as some special purpose systems for solving problems in a particular area such as ordinary differential equations  the advantage of restricting the problem area is that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified in this paper we discuss some of the advantages accrued by such systems and design considerations for interactive routines  furthermore an implementation of an online least squares datafitting program peg is presented with results obtained from empirical data  in conclusion area for future work in this field are discussed cacm october 1970 smith l b
