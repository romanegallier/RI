vminan optimal variablespace page replacement algorithm a criterion for comparing variable space page replacement algorithms is presented  an optimum  page replacement algorithm called vmin is described and shown to be optimum with respect to this criterion  the results of simulating vmin dennings working set and the page partitioning replacement algorithms  on five virtual memory programs are presented to demonstrate the improvement possible over the known  realizable variable space algorithms cacm may 1976 prieve b g fabry r s
