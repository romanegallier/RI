a comparison of simulation event list algorithms four algorithms are considered which can be used to schedule events in a general purpose discrete  simulation system  two of the algorithms are new one is based on an endorder tree structure for event  notices and another uses an indexed linear list the algorithms are tested with a set of typical stochastic  scheduling distributions especially chosen to show the advantages and limitations of the algorithms   the endorder tree algorithm is shown to be an advantageous immediate replacement for the algorithm  in use with current simulation languages  the most promising algorithm uses the indexed list concept   it will require an adaptive routine before it can be employed in general purpose simulatorsbut its  performance is such that further study would be fruitful cacm april 1975 vaucher j g duval p
