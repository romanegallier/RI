on arithmetic expressions and trees a description is given of how a tree representing the evaluation of an arithmetic expression  can be drawn in such a way that the number of accumulators needed for the computation can be represented  in a straightforward manner  this representation reduces the choice of the best order of computation  to a specific problem under the theory of graphs  an algorithm to solve this problem is presented cacm february 1969 redziejowski r r
