hybrid simulation models of computer systems this paper describes the structure and operation of a hybrid simulation model in which both  discreteevent simulation and analytic techniques are combined to produce efficient yet accurate system  models  in an example based on a simple hypothetical computer system discreteevent simulation is used  to model the arrival and activation of jobs and a centralserver queueing network models the use of  system processors  the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid technique are demonstrated by comparing  the result and computational costs of the hybrid model of the example with those of an equivalent simulationonly  model   cacm september 1978 schwetman hd
