packed scatter tables scatter tables for open addressing benefit from recursive entry displacements cutoffs for  unsuccessful searches and auxiliary cost functions  compared with conventional methods the new techniques  provide substantially improved tables that resemble exactsolution optimal packings  the displacements  are depthlimited approximations to an enumerative exhaustive optimization although packing costs  remain linearonwith table size n  the techniques are primarily suited for important fixed but possibly  quite large tables for which reference frequencies may be known opcode tablesspelling dictionaries  access arrays  introduction of frequency weights further improves retrievals but the enhancement may  degrade cutoffs   cacm october 1978 lyon g
