length of strings for a merge sort detailed statistics are given on the length of maximal sorted strings which result form the  first internal sort phase of a merge sort onto tapes  it is shown that the strings produced by an  alternating method ie one which produces ascending and descending strings alternately tend to be  only threefourths as long as those in a method which produces only ascending strings contrary to statements  which have appeared previously in the literature  a slight modification of the readbackward polyphase  merge algorithm is therefore suggested cacm november 1963 knuth d e
