designing surfaces in 3d an experimental system for computeraided design of freeform surfaces in three dimensions  is described the surfaces are represented in the system as parametric basis splines the principal features  of the system are 1 the surfaces are rendered as isoparametric line drawings on a headmounted display  and they are designed with the aid of a threedimensional wand which allows 3d movements of the points  controlling the shapes of the surfaces 2 all of the interactions with the surfaces are in realtime  and 3 the mathematical formulations used assume no knowledge of them by the user of the system  also  examined are some of the features that should be part of a practical 3d system for designing spaceforms cacm august 1976 clark j h
