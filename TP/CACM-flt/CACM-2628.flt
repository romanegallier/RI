minimaltotalprocessing time drum and disk scheduling disciplines this article investigates the application of minimaltotalprocessingtime mtpt scheduling  disciplines to rotating storage units when random arrival of requests is allowed  fixedhead drum and  movinghead drum and movinghead disk storage units are considered and emphasis is placed on the relative  merits of the mtpt scheduling discipline with respect to the shortestlatencytimefirst sltf scheduling  discipline  the results of the simulation studies presented show that neither scheduling discipline  is unconditionally superior to the other  for most fixedhead drum applications the sltf discipline  is preferable to mtpt but for intracylinder disk scheduling the mtpt discipline offers a distinct advantage  over the sltf discipline  the computational requirements of an algorithm that implements the mtpt scheduling  discipline are shown to be comparable to sltf algorithms in both cases the sorting procedure is the  most timeconsuming phase of the algorithm cacm july 1974 fuller s h
