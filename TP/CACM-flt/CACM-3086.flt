on the complexity of computing the measure of uai bi the decision tree complexity of computing the measure of the union of n possibly overlapping  intervals is shown to be  n log n even if comparisons between linear functions of the interval endpoints  are allowed  the existence of an   n log n lower bound to determine whether any two of n real numbers  are within   of each other is also demonstrated  these problems provide an excellent opportunity for  discussing the effects of the computational model on the ease of analysis and on the results produced cacm july 1978 fredman ml weide b
