synchronization in a parallelaccessed data base the following problem is considered  given a data base which can be manipulated simultaneously  by more than one process what are the rules for synchronization which will maximize the amount of parallel  activity allowed  it is assumed that the data base can be represented as a graph  an example of such  a data base is a hierarchy of directories for an online file system  methods for synchronization of  processes are examined their validity is discussed and their performance compared cacm november 1969 shoshani a bernstein a j
