representation of contours ad regions for efficient computer search a novel computersearchable representation for the three basic pictorial features contour  maps region coverage and line structures is described  the representation which has practical storage  requirements provides a rapid mean of searching large files for data associated with geometric position  as well as with attribute value  an application of this representation to handling terrain information  illustrates its utility  the algebraic properties of the data structure make it computationally easy  to determine whether a point lies within a closed boundary compute the area contained by a closed boundary  generate the closed boundary representing the union or intersection of two closed boundaries and determine  the neighboring boundaries to a point and the minimum distances between them and the point cacm february 1973 merrill r d
