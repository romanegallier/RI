an interactive computer graphics approach to surface representation an in teractive computer graphics method has been developed for the rapid generation of arbitrary  shaped threedimensional surfaces  the method is a synthesis of spline theory and algorithms an in teractive  means for manmachine communication and software for static or dynamic graphics display  the basic  technique employed is a modified lofting method on which sectional curves are represented by uniform  bsplines and the surface is in terpolated between sections by cardinal splines  among the features of  this method are algorithms which enable in teractive modification of the bspline representation of the  sectional curves  at all stages of the process the spatial information is graphically displayed to  the user  complex surfaces can be created by the combination of a number of shapes that have been separately  generated and automatically joined  the system has been successfully in terfaced to a variety of analytical  routines for structural medical and graphical applications cacm october 1977 wu shengchuan abel j f greenberg d p
