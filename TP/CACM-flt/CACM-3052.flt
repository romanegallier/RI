coldstart vs warmstart miss ratios in a twolevel computer storage hierarchy miss ratio measurements are often made from a cold  start that is made with the firstlevel  store initially empty  for large capacities the effect on  the measured miss ratio of the misses incurred while filling the firstlevel store can be significant  even for long reference strings  use of warmstart rather than coldstart miss ratios cast doubt  on the widespread belief that the observed sshape of lifetime reciprocal of miss ratio versus capacity  curve indicates a property of behavior of programs that maintain a constant number of pages in main storage   on the other hand if coldstart miss ratios are measured as a function of capacity and measurement  length then they are useful in studying systems in which operation of a program is periodically interrupted  by task switches  it is shown how to obtain under simple assumptions the cache miss ratio for multiprogramming  from coldstart miss ratio values and how to obtain approximate coldstart miss ratios from warmstart  miss ratios cacm october 1978 easton mc fagin r
