event manipulation for discrete simulations requiring large numbers of events the eventmanipulation system presented here consists of two major parts  the first part addresses  the familiar problem of event scheduling efficiency when the number of scheduled events grows large   the second part deals with the less apparent problem of providing efficiency and flexibility as scheduled  events are accessed to be executed  additional features and problems dealt with include the proper handling  of simultaneous events that certain events must be created scheduled and executed at the same points  in simulated time that infinite loops caused by the concatenation of such zerotime events are possible  and must be diagnosed that maintaining various event counts is practical and economical and that a  capability for handling  timedisplaceable events is desirable and possible   cacm september 1978 ulrich eg
