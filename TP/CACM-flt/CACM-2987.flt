representation of manysided polygons and polygonal lines for rapid processing a representation for polygons and polygonal lines is described which allows sets of consecutive  sides to be collectively examined  the set of sides are arranged in a binary tree hierarchy by inclusion   a fast algorithm for testing the inclusion of a poin t in a manysided polygon is given  the speed of  the algorithm is discussed for both ideal and practical examples  it is shown that the poin ts of intersection  of two polygonal lines can be located by what is essentially a binary tree search  the algorithm and  a practical example are discussed  the representation overcomes many of the disadvantages associated  with the various fixedgrid methods for representing curves and regions cacm march 1977 burton w
