index ranges for matrix calculi the paper describes a scheme for symbolic manipulation of index expressions which arise as  a byproduct of the symbolic manipulation of expressions in the matrix calculi described by the authors  in a previous paper  this scheme attempts program optimization by transforming the original algorithm  rather than the machine code  the goal is to automatically generate code for handling the tedious address  calculations necessitated by complicated data structures  the paper is therefore preoccupied with indexing  by position  the relationship of indexing by name and indexing by position is discussed cacm december 1972 bayer r witzgall c
