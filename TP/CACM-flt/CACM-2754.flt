a syntactic algorithm for peak detection in waveforms with applications to cardiography peaks in a digitized waveform are detected by an algorithm incorporating piecewise linear approximation  and tabular parsing techniques  several parameters serve to identify the waveform context enabling accurate  measurement of peak amplitude duration and shape  the algorithm is of sufficient speed to allow online  realtime processing  an example of its application is demonstrated on an electrocardiogram cacm may 1975 horowitz s l
