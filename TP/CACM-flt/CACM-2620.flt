execution time requirements for encipherment programs although encipherment has often been discussed as a means to protect computer data its costs  are not well established  five experiments were conducted to measure the cpu time on a cdc 6400 required  by additive ciphers programmed both in assembly language and in fortran a null transformation to measure  the time to move data without encipherment encipherment with oneword key encipherment with a 125word  key double key encipherment and encipherment using a pseudo random key  the results were analyzed  for consistency over 100 runs and the effects of constant and intermittent errors were considered   timing rates for assembly language encipherment ranged from 498800 characters per second for a pseudo  random key cipher to 2092000 characters per second for a constant oneword key cipher  the latter  is almost equivalent to the rate required simply to move data without encipherment  fortran tests required  over four times as much cpu time  this paper introduces the idea on enciphering time coefficient the  ratio of enciphering time to the time taken to fetch and store data without encipherment cacm august 1974 friedman t d offman l j
