nearminimax polynomial approximations and partitioning of intervals a method of nearminimax polynomial approximation is described  as a byproduct this method  provides a formula for an estimate of the maximum error associated with a given degree of approximation   using this formula a partitioning algorithm is obtained for dividing a basic interval into subintervals  for which approximations of equal degree give equal maximum error cacm august 1964 fraser w hart j f
