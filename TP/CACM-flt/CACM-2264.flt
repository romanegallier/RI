derived semantics for some programming language constructs the constructs of a simple programming language are introduced and described informally in  terms of values and sideeffects  a translator is defined which translates the language into flowcharts  for a simple machine  the action of the machine in executing a flowchart is defined  a proof is constructed  that the effect of translating and executing any program can be expressed solely in terms of the value  and sideeffect of the program  during the course of constructing the proof formal definitions of the  concepts of value and sideeffect are derived in order to make the proof rigorous  correctness of the  implementation involves checking that the definitions derived in the step above are an acceptable formalization  of the informal description given in the first step cacm november 1972 henderson p
