database abstractions aggregation aggregation is in troduced as an abstraction which is important in conceptualizing the real  world  aggregation transforms a relationship between objects into a higherlevel object  a new data  type called aggregation is developed which under certain criteria of welldefinedness specifies  aggregation abstractions  relational databases defined as collections of aggregates are structured as  a hierarchy on nary relations  to main tain welldefinedness update operations on such databases must  preserve two invariants  welldefined relations are distinct from relations in third normal form  it  is shown that these notions are complementary and both are important in database design  a topdown  methodology for database design is described which separates decisions concerning aggregate structure  from decisions concerning key identification  it is suggested that aggregate types and other types  which support realworld abstractions without in troducing implementation detail should be incorporated  into programming languages cacm june 1977 smith j m smith d c p
