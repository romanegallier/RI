a procedure for generation of threedimensional halftoned computer graphics presentations a description is given of an algorithm for producing computer generated  halftone presentations of threedimensional polygonal surface structures   this algorithm achieves a significant increase in speed of computation over  the warnock algorithm developed at the university of utah and implemented also on the coordinated science laboratory cdc 1604 computer system at the university of illinois  the history leading to the algorithm development and then the algorithm itself are described results are presented and are compared with computer runs achieved by the warnock approach  an extension of the procedure to variable position illumination sources is also given cacm september 1970 bouknight w j
