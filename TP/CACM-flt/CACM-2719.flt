mechanical program analysis one means of analyzing program performance is by deriving closedform expressions for their  execution behavior  this paper discusses the mechanization of such analysis and describes a system  metric which is able to analyze simple lisp programs and produce for example closedform expressions for their running time expressed in terms of size of input  this paper presents the reasons for mechanizing  program analysis describes the operation of metric explains its implementation and discusses its limitations cacm september 1975 wegbreit b
