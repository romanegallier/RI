on the expected lengths of sequences generated in sorting by replacement selecting in the replacementselecting technique of sorting one is interested in the ratio lj of the  expected length of the jth sequence generated by the technique to the number of memory cells used   using complexvariable theory it is shown that lj  2 and that asymptotically the average interval  between sign changes of lj2 is 26662 cacm july 1969 hooker w w
