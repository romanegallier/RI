experiments with the m  n treesearching program the m  n procedure is an improvement to the minimax backingup procedure widely used in computer program for gameplaying and other purposes  it is based on the principle that it is desirable to have many options when making decisions in the face of uncertainty  the minimax procedure assigns to a max min node the value of the highest lowest valued successor to that node  the m  n procedure assigns to a max min node some function of the m n highest lowest valued successors  an m  n procedure was written in lisp to play the game of kalah and it was demonstrated that  the m  n procedure is significantly superior to the minimax procedure  the statistical significance of important conclusions is given  since information on statistical significance has often been lacking in papers  on computer experiments in the artificial intelligence field these experiments  can perhaps serve as a model for future work cacm march 1970 slagle j r dixon j k
