the design implementation and evaluation of a working set dispatcher the behavior of a computer system is largely dependent upon the algorithms employed to allocate  the system resources to the processes competing for them  recent research in timesharing paging systems  has developed the working set model for program behavior and are source allocation strategy based on  this model has been proposed  two implementations along these principles have been reported but it  seems that in neither case have further results been announced  this report discusses the design and  implementation of a dispatcher based on the working set principle presents data to permit analysis of  its behavior and indicates future directions of research on methods of controlling a computer system cacm april 1973 rodriguezrosell j dupuy j p
