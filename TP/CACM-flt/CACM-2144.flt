on accurate floatingpoint summation the accumulation of floatingpoint sums is considered on a computer which performs tdigit  base b floatingpoint addition with exponents in the range m to m  an algorithm is given for accurately  summing n tdigit floatingpoint numbers  each of these n numbers is split into q parts forming qn  tdigit floatingpoint numbers  each of these is then added to the appropriate one of n auxiliary tdigit  accumulators  finally the accumulators are added together to yield the computed sum  in all qnn1  tdigit floatingpoint additions are performed  under usual conditions the relative error in the computed  sum is at most t1vb1t for some v  further with an additional qn1 tdigit additions the  computed sum can be corrected to full tdigit accuracy  for example for the ibm360 b16 t14 m63  m64 typical values for q and n are q2 and n32  in this case  becomes n  32768 and we have  t1vb1t  4x1613 cacm november 1971 malcolm m a
