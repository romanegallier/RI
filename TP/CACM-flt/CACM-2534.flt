design and implementation of a diagnostic compiler for pli plc is a compiler for a dialect for pli  the design objective was to provide a maximum degree  of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment  for the most part this assistance is implicit  and is provided automatically by the compiler the most remarkable characteristic of plc is its perseveranceit  completes translation of every program submitted and continues execution until a userestablished error  limit is reached this requires that the compiler repair errors encountered during both translation  and execution and the design of plc is dominated by this consideration  plc also introduces several  explicit usercontrolled facilities for program testing  to accommodate these extensions to pli without  abandoning compatibility with ibm compiler plc permits pseudo commentsconstructions whose contents  can optionally be considered either source test or comment  in spite of the diagnostic effort plc is  a fast and efficient processor  it effectively demonstrates that compilers can provide better diagnostic  assistance than is customarily offered even when a sophisticated source language is employed and that  this assistance need not be prohibitively costly cacm march 1973 conway r w wilcox t r
