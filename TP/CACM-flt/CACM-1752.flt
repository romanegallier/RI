resource management for a medium scale timesharing operating system task scheduling and resource balancing for a medium size virtual memory paging machine are  discussed in relation to a combined batch processing and timesharing environment  a synopsis is given  of the task scheduling and paging algorithms that were implemented and the results of comparative simulation  are given by tracing the development of the algorithms through six predecessor versions  throughout  the discussion particular emphasis is placed on balancing the system performance relative to the characteristics  of all the system resources  simulation results relative to alternate hardware characteristics and the  effects of program mix and loading variations are also presented cacm may 1968 oppenheimer g weizer n
