simple lrk grammars a class of contextfree grammars called the simple lrk or slrk grammars is defined   this class has been shown to include weak precedence and simple precedence grammars as proper subsets   how to construct parsers for the slrk grammars is also shown  these parserconstruction techniques  are extendible to cover all of the lrk grammars of knuth they have been implemented and by direct  comparison proved to be superior to precedence techniques not only in the range of grammars covered  but also in the speed of parser construction and in the size and speed of the resulting parsers cacm july 1971 deremer f l
