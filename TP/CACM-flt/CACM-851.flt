design and characteristics of a variablelength record sort using new fixedlength record sorting  techniques this paper describes the application of several new techniques for sorting fixedlength records  to the problems of variablelength record sorting  the techniques have been implemented on a sylvania  9400 computer system with 32000 fixedlength words of memory  specifically the techniques sequence  variablelength records of unrestricted size produce long initial strings of data merge strings of  data at the power of t1 where t is the number of work tapes in a system and do not restrict the volume  of input data cacm may1963 goetz m a
