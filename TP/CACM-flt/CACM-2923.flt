highlevel data flow analysis in contrast to the predominant use of lowlevel in termediate text highlevel data flow analysis  deals with programs essentially at source level and exploits the control flow information implicit in  the parse tree  the need for highlevel flow analysis arises from several aspects of recent work on  advanced methods of program certification and optimization  this paper proposes a simple general method  of highlevel data flow analysis that allows free use of escape and jump statements avoids large graphs  when compiling large programs facilitates updating of data flow information to reflect program changes  and derives new global information helpful in solving many familiar global flow analysis problems  an  illustrative application to live variable analysis is presented  many of the graphs involved are constructed  and analyzed before any programs are compiled thus avoiding certain costs that lowlevel methods incur  repeatedly at compile time cacm october 1977 rosen b k
