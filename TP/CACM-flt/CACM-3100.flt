an interference matching technique for inducing abstractions a method for inducing knowledge by abstraction from a sequence of training examples is described   the proposed method interference matching induces abstractions by finding relational properties common  to two or more exemplars  three tasks solved by a program that uses an interferencematching algorithm  are presented  several problems concerning the description of the training examples and the adequacy  of interference matching are discussed and directions for future research are considered cacm may 1978 hayesroth f mcdermott j
