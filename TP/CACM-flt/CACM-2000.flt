a variation of the goodmanlance method for the solution of twopoint boundary value problems a recently published method for the interpolative solution of nonlinear equations is improved and applied to give a significant variation of the goodmanlance method for the solution of twopoint boundary value problems  the resulting method applies in particular to the numerical solution of optimal control problems in the eulerlagrange formulation quantitative estimates are presented which indicate that the variation is nearly twice as fast on some problems in the latter context cacm september 1970 kimble g w
