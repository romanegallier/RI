capabilitybased addressing various addressing schemes making use of segment tables are examined  the inadequacies of  these schemes when dealing with shared addresses are explained these inadequacies are traced to the  lack of an efficient absolute address for objects in these systems  the direct use of a capability as  an address is shown to overcome these difficulties because it provides the needed absolute address   implementation of capabilitybased addressing is discussed  it is predicted that the use of tags to  identify capabilities will dominate  a hardware address translation scheme which never requires the  modification of the representation of capabilities is suggested the scheme uses a main memory hash table  for obtaining a segments location in main memory given its unique code  the hash table is avoided for recently accessed segments by means of a set of associative registers  a computer using capabilitybased  addressing may be substantially superior to present systems on the basis of protection simplicity of  programming conventions and efficient implementation cacm july 1974 fabry r s
