improving the access time for random access files clustering in the key set is decreased by smoothing the keytoaddress transformation and  by adding shadow buckets to an open chaining file  the keys are prehashed before the address division  to remove the effect of sequential properties in the key set  shadow buckets in the key search sequence  reduce the effect of nonuniformity in file loading and decrease the number of maximum probes needed  to locate a record  the combined effects of these techniques lead to improved file performance for secondary  storage devices as shown by empirical studies cacm march 1977 clapson p
