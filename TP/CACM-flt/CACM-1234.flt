the structure of yet another algol compiler a highspeed top down method of syntax analysis which completely eliminates backup of  the source string has been implemented in a convenient macrolanguage  a technique of  simulation at  compile time of the use of a conventional runtime stack enables the generation of code for expressions  which minimizes stores fetches and stackpointer motion at run time while properly trating recursion  and side effects of procedures  block structure and recursion are handled without need for interpretive  methods at run times  the context problem in the transmission to recursive procedures of parameters  called by name is solved in a manner which permits the handling of the common cases of simple expressions  and array identifiers with particular efficiency cacm july 1965 kanner h kosinski p robinson c l
