variableprecision exponentiation a previous paper presented an efficient algorithm called the recomputation algorithm for  evaluating a rational expression to within any desired tolerance on a computer which performs variableprecision  arithmetic operations  the recomputation algorithm can be applied to expressions involving any variableprecision  operations having o10p  sumei error bounds where p denotes the operations precision and  ei denotes the error in the operations ith argument  this paper presents an efficient variableprecision  exponential operation with an error bound of the above order  other operations such as log sin and  cos which have simple series expansions can be handled similarly cacm january 1973 richman p l
