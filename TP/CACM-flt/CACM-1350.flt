the augmented predictive analyzer for contextfree languagesits relative efficiency it has been proven by greibach that for a given contextfree grammar g a standardform grammar  gs can be constructed which generates the same languages as is generated by g and whose rules are all  of the form z  cy1  ym m  o where z and yi are intermediate symbols and c a terminal  symbol  since the predictive analyzer at harvard uses a standardform grammar it can accept the language  of any contextfree grammar g given an equivalent standardform grammar gs  the structural descriptions  sdgsx assigned to a given sentence x by the predictive analyzer however are usually different from  the structural descriptions sdgx assigned to the same sentence by the original contextfree grammar  g from which gs is derived  in section 1 an algorithm originally due to abbott is described standardform  grammar each of whose rules is in standard form supplemented by additional information describing its  derivation from the original contextfree grammar  a technique for performing the sdgsx to sdgx  transformation effectively is also described  in section 2 the augmented predictive analyzer as a parsing  algorithm for arbitrary contextfree languages is compared with two other parsing algorithms a selective  toptobottom algorithm similar to irons error correcting parse algorithm and an immediate constituent  analyzer which is an extension of sakaicockes algorithm for normal grammars  the comparison is based  upon several criteria of efficiency covering corestorage requirements complexities of the programs  and processing time cacm november 1966 kunos
