groovea program to compose store and edit functions of time a program which makes possible creating storing reproducing and editing functions of time is described  the functions are typical of those generated by human beings  multiple functions up to 14 are produced for long periods of time up to several hours at sufficiently high sampling rates to describe fast human reactions up to 200 samples per second  the functions can be used for a variety of purposes such as the control of machine tools or sound synthesizers or anything a person normally controls  the program operates on a small computer ddp224  functions are stored on a disk file  functions may be created by realtime human inputs to the computer which can interact with already stored functions and computed functions  realtime feedback from the process being controlled is an important link in the system  the environment for effective manmachine interaction has been carefully nurtured cacm december 1970 mathews m v moore f r
