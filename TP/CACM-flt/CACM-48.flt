shiftregister code for indexing applications in this communication the use of a shiftregister code with n  10 is described for calling  64 wireless telemetering stations in a fixed cyclical order  a high degree of redundancy is used permitting  a singleerror correcting code minimumdistancethree code with 64 10bit code words to be employed  as the station identification code  embedding this in the shiftregister code with period 1023 permits  the code to be employed without punctuation each of the telemetering station receivers simply putting  received ones and zeros into a shift register  each time the given code combination arises identifying  the particular station barring for tuitous error combinations of very low probability it has been called   the communication describes the properties and application of the code in some detail and the finding  of the particular example to be employed on ural the sovietbuilt drum computer donated to the indian  statistical institute by the united nations technical aid administration untaa cacm october 1959 nadler m sengupta a
