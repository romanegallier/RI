analyses of deterministic parsing algorithms this paper describes an approach for determining the minimum maximum and average times to  parse sentences acceptable by a deterministic parser  these quantities are presented in the form of  symbolic formulas called timeformulas  the variables in these formulas represent not only the length  of the input string but also the time to perform elementary operations such as pushing popping subscripting  iterating etc  by binding to the  variables actual numerical values corresponding to a given compilermachine  configuration one can determine the execution time for that configuration  timeformulas are derived  by examining the grammar rules and the program representing the algorithm one wishes to analyze  the  approach is described by using a specific grammar that defines simple arithmetic expressions  two deterministic parsers are analyzed a topdown recursive descent ll1 parser and a bottomup slr1 parser  the  paper provides estimates for the relative efficiencies of the two parsers  the estimates applicable  to a specific machine the pdp10 are presented and substantiated buy benchmarks  finally the paper  illustrates the proposed approach by applying it to the analyses of parsers for a simple programming  language   cacm june 1978 cohen j roth ms
