proving termination multiset orderings common tool proving termination programs wellfounded set set ordered admit infinite descending sequences basic approach find termination function  maps values program variables wellfounded set termination function repeatedly reduced computation  termination functions required  difficult find complexity proportion program consideration multisets bags wellfounded set sets admit multiple occurrences elements  ordering induces ordering finite multisets  multiset ordering shown wellfounded  multiset ordering enables simple intuitive termination functions difficult termination proofs  multiset ordering prove termination production systems programs defined terms sets rewriting rules  cacm august dershowitz manna
