 I'd like to find articles describing the use of singular value decomposition in digital image processing.  Applications include finding approximations to the original image and restoring images that are subject to noise. An article on the subject is H.C. Andrews and C.L. Patterson "Outer product expansions and their uses in digital image processing", American Mathematical Monthly, vol. 82. Andrews, H.C. Patterson, C.L.
