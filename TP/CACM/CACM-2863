VMIN-An Optimal Variable-Space Page Replacement Algorithm A criterion for comparing variable space page replacement algorithms is presented.  An optimum  page replacement algorithm, called VMIN, is described and shown to be optimum with respect to this criterion.  The results of simulating VMIN, Denning's working set, and the page partitioning replacement algorithms  on five virtual memory programs are presented to demonstrate the improvement possible over the known  realizable variable space algorithms.
